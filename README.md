# Covid-19-Tracking-System
CST - 1st Semester mini project

1.Introduction

With the spread of covid-19 in Sri Lanka, we came up with the idea of creating a new
technological tool for managing covid 19 using the latest technology and programming
knowledge we have learned to prevent the spread of covid-19.

Here we looked at different ideas for it and the main thing we found was that what needs to be
done here is to track patients with covid-19 and find their associates and prevent them from
spreading to them through quarantine. It seems that this will make the work of the public service
much easier in practical.

2.Scenario

The main problem we can find in the world these days is the covid -19 virus.

In a typical system, for example, when you go to an institution, there is a pen with a book on
the front of the institution. We write our name, address, and National Identity Card number on
it. But one problem there is now is that everyone who comes uses the same pen. This
increases the risk of contracting the covid 19 virus. Also, it is not easy to get the relevant
information through this type of hard copy if you want to know some information as a primary
problem here. The efficiency of this process is low.

In fact, with the normal system, we can only get information in one place.
This process is not efficient. Because it's hard for people to go. You have to go there and stay
for a long time. Also, if several members of a family come, only one person represents several
members of the family. Then everyone's information will not be available.

3.solution

What happens in this normal system is that people are made aware of a certain place. Our
newly created system is really about awareness of places through people.
If a person is infected with the Covid 19 virus, when we insert it into our system, we can track
all places where he went through our system data. Our system really does is store data so that
we can get the data. This can prevent the Covid-19 virus from infecting individuals.

4.processing system

This system allows PHIs to obtain covid-19 information about individuals within their Grama
Niladhari domain.so We selected Galigammuwa divisional Secretariat for this system.We
have included all the Grama Niladhari Divisions in Galigamuwa Divisional Secretariat in this
system.

The main role here is done by PHI. The process itself takes place under 4 parts.

 Registering people in the system is the main part of this

 registering places in the system

 PHI's Procedure

 tracking system

Every company has a username and password. Also, the relevant person must be pre-
registered in the system. After the relevant person registers with the system, when a
company starts in the morning, the relevant person has to log in to the system first. In this
way, the system records the information of the people who come to the institution on a daily
basis.

What usually happens in a system is that the person's ID number is written in a book. But
what happens here is that the NIC number is typed in the system. Once it is entered, the
relevant person will automatically record the time of entry into the organization and all other
databases in this manner.

Each domain has a PHI. Domain information can only be viewed by PHIs in the relevant
domain. PHI can find Data on vaccinations of persons in PHI's domain and all their other
information here.

Its other convenience is that when it finds out that someone in their domain is infected with
covid-19, PHI can log in to the system and track and find all places where the he went of the
covid-19 infected person through the tracking system. After that, this information to the
institutions and places where the person has gone will be informed.

The first function of our system is to register people in this system. Only those who are
registered in the system can work in the system. When the person enters the ID number, the
system will check if the relevant person is a previously registered person. If that person has
not registered before, the person will need to register anew at that time.

As for the registration part, we take the person's name and ID number. The system checks
the ID number to see if it has been registered before. It checks if the ID number is under the
relevant conditions. If it is not a valid ID number, it will be re-entered. Then check the
password. The password will be entered twice. Then the password entered twice will be
checked to see if it matches. If it does not match, the password will be entered again.

Next, get the age and phone number into the system. Then check the information about the
vaccination. Then select the Grama Niladhari Division where relevant persons reside. This
system shows only a few domains pertaining to the Galigamuwa Divisional Secretariat.
next need to select the job role. Here it's basically PHI and some other type. Later, with the
aim of improving this system, we have added the police and Grama Niladhari to this
system. Here, only the PHI has to add their working division to the system.

Consider place registration. Here first enter the name of the place. Next, we need to provide
the user name there. When giving a user name, you need to type it without space. And it
should be no one else has used before. As above, after entering the username, the system
checks if it has been used before. If it has been used, it will come back to enter.

Next we need to select the type of place. We recently added to the system to select whether
it is a bank, a restaurant, a grocery shop, a supermarket, a liquor shop, a pharmacy, a textile
shop or a saloon. You need to select the relevant type from these. Then we need to select
the location. There you have to select what is the Grama Niladhari Division where the
relevant place is located.
